# Web Application Penetration Testing – OWASP Top 10

## Overview
This project demonstrates a professional approach to Web Application Penetration Testing
aligned with the OWASP Top 10 framework. The assessment was performed in a controlled
lab environment to simulate a real-world penetration testing engagement.

The objective was to identify, exploit, and document common web application vulnerabilities
and provide risk-based remediation recommendations.

## Objectives
- Perform manual and automated web application security testing
- Identify vulnerabilities mapped to OWASP Top 10
- Demonstrate exploitation with proof of concept
- Analyze security and business impact
- Provide mitigation and remediation recommendations

## Scope of Testing
The following OWASP Top 10 categories were tested:

- A01: Broken Access Control
- A02: Broken Authentication
- A03: Injection (SQL Injection)
- A05: Security Misconfiguration
- A07: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## Tools & Technologies
- Kali Linux
- Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
- Burp Suite (Community Edition)
- Nmap
- SQLmap
- Apache & MySQL

## Methodology
A structured penetration testing methodology was followed:
1. Reconnaissance and Enumeration
2. Vulnerability Identification
3. Manual Exploitation
4. Impact Analysis
5. Risk Assessment
6. Remediation Recommendations

## Key Outcomes
- Identified multiple high-risk vulnerabilities
- Successfully exploited vulnerabilities using manual techniques and tools
- Documented findings in a professional penetration testing format
- Recommended secure coding and configuration practices
